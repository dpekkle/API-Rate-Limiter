A simple node express implementation of an API Rate Limiter. 

See here for more information on rate limiting, and different strategies that can be employed:
https://konghq.com/blog/how-to-design-a-scalable-rate-limiting-algorithm/

Rate limiting algorithms are:
- Sliding Log
- Fixed Window

There is room to easily extend the implementation to use different strategies.
